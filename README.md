# CampusChaos
### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mick Kohler
**I am a programming starter and student at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.**
CampusChoas is a variation of the classic game "Malefiz". In a nutshell, it is a game in which
players try to move their pieces from a starting point to a finishing point. In doing so
they can capture opposing pieces and move obstacles. The game ends as soon as a player
has moved one of their pieces to the targetc cell. However, the game also provides "meta-management",
where the player can create, switch, delete... different sessions. 

For the original Malefiz game, see [Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malefiz_(Spiel)). 
The details of my version, CampusChaos, can be seen [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17445319/Abschlussaufgabe1Assignment.pdf).  
If you want the short version, type "help" into the command line. 


**BUG**
- the figure created by the "new figure" command is not recognized by the move (obstacle ) commands
